Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing.

New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

For example, only 5 of the synapses of a neuron in the real network in the visual cortex listen to bottom-up input signals yet current neural networks are primarily concerned with feed-forward computation. What are the functions of the other 95 of the synapses of a neuron? What could be the computational roles of the recurrent connections in the real biological circuits? What other learning rules are known or implementable in the real circuits? Can we develop new computational vision models and machine learning techniques from our knowledge of the cortical neural circuits?

As a performing artist, you can use the Alexander Technique to help you prevent or manage common performance problems such as: stage fright, lack of poise or confidence, lack of breath control, vocal strain, and physical discomfort while practicing or performing.  The Alexander Technique offers relief from many physical problems that interfere with performing. This includes, but is not limited to, poor posture, headaches, jaw tension, and repetitive strain injuries.

To a large extent, our ability to make sense of the world is therefore limited by our capacity to design, process, and analyze geometric data.  The field of discrete differential geometry (DDG) applies ideas from smooth differential geometry to computational algorithms for analyzing and manipulating real-world geometric data.  This course serves as a first course on differential geometry that treats both smooth and discrete objects from a single unified point of view.

The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

Students will read background literature on the overall energy landscape, study scholarship addressing energy issues of local concern, and collaborate with partners to develop innovative deliberative designs for three events in the National Academies Energy Issues Forum. Through their work, students will increase their own understanding of and ability to engage publicly with energy issues, as well as contribute to the mission of the National Academies and the welfare of our local community.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.

Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation.

Facebook, Twitter, Google and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. We introduce fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study several tools aimed at measuring causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool will be discussed in the context of a specific example that students can work on using real world datasets. Each class starts with introduction to concepts and ideas and ends with in-class hands-on exercises using these datasets. Significant effort will be placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments to measure causal effects.

In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring modification of scripts to perform computational analyses. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models.

We will also examine musical representations of place, weather, and animals through the perspectives of ecocriticism and notions of the pastoral. Repertory will include Vivaldis Spring Concerto, Beethovens Pastoral Symphony, Wagners Ring of the Nibelung, Mahlers Symphony No. 3, and Debussys La Mer. We will compare landscapes by Sibelius and Copland, birds by Dvorak, Bartk, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Messiaen, and whales by Crumb and Hovhaness. We will also treat statements on the environmental crisis by composers Harrison Birtwistle, Philip Glass, Peter Sculthorpe, and John Luther Adams.

The new Christian teachings were reshaped to fit in to the traditional cosmology, and throughout the eighteenth century, and even into the early nineteenth in some isolated regions, a double belief was maintained - one that became double trouble with two sources of forces to fear.

These are: Aleksandr Pushkin (The Bronze Horseman), Mikhail Lermontov (The Demon), Nikolai Gogol (Viy), Fyodor Dostoevsky (Demons, also known as The Possessed), Andrey Bely (Petersburg) and Mikhail Bulgakov (The Master and Margarita).

How can a network be compromised or made resilient? Such questions can be addressed using Network Science.  Network Science, a.k.a. social network analysis and link analysis, is a fast-growing interdisciplinary field aimed at understanding simple  high dimensional networks, from both a static and a dynamic perspective.  Across an unlimited application space, graph theoretic, statistical,  simulation methodologies are used.  An interdisciplinary perspective on network science is provided, with an emphasis on high-dimensional dynamic data. The fundamentals of network science, methods, theories, metrics  confidence estimation, constraints on data collection  bias, and key research findings  challenges are examined.  Illustrative networks discussed include social media based (e.g., twitter), disaster response, organizational, semantic, political elite, crises, terror,  P2P networks.  Critical procedures covered include: basic centralities and metrics, group and community detection, link inference, network change detection, comparative analytics, and big data techniques.  Applications from business, science, art, medicine, forensics, social media  numerous other areas are explored.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.  Learning Objectives  Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:   Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.   Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.  Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others.  Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics.

The standard history also insists that realism, while dominant in the 19th century, becomes a residual form in the 20th, replaced first by modernism, then postmodernism.  In global/postcolonial fiction, ludic form, especially magical realism, becomes an important standard bearer of progressive politics in the mid20th century, again perceiving realism as residual.   This course interrogates that history by looking again at classic realist texts from France and England, reading them in conjunction with novels from the U.S., India, the Caribbean, and Africa, by charting uneven development of forms and richer modes of reading.

NCLB provides an unprecedented opportunity for basic research in the learning sciences to contribute to educational practice. That is the topic of this seminar. Questions we will address: 1. What does scientifically based education research mean?  - Does it mean the sort of CMU-ish studies that cognitive and developmental psychologists do when they are interested in how students think about math or science or reading?  - Does it mean massive national randomized field trials on the effect of class size or teacher training or one curriculum versus another?  - Can it include non-experimental, qualitative, case studies and field demonstrations?  - Must it include new technologies that go beyond traditional teacher-student interactions?  2. What constitutes a treatment or an independent variable: lesson content, instructional method, teacher qualifications, student attributes,      educational ?philosophy?  ?approach? 3.

This creates an exciting opportunity for explorative research on speech input and output, speech-to-speech translation, or any aspect of language technology. Of particular interest will be a combination with other novel real world (RW) input, or output devices, such as mobile phones or portable games consoles, because they can be used to control the VW, or make it accessible everywhere in RW. Language technologies in particular profit from context awareness, because domain adaptation can be performed. For scientific experimentation in that area, Virtual Worlds offer the opportunity to concentrate on algorithms, because context sensors can be written with a few lines of code, without the need for extra hardware sensors. Algorithms can also run continuously, without the need for specific data collection times or places, because the VW is always on.

Imagine the compelling motivational strategies of well-designed games used to spark inquiry and scientific curiosity.  Imagine immersive experiences that deepen our capacity for critical thinking, empathy or compassion.  What if we applied absorbing interactive media to the task of delivering a first-rate humane education?   In this course, we will explore a topic of elemental human concern (e.g. inequality, abortion and human reproduction, the nature of the social contract, the separation of church and state, population and sustainability) and develop a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of the issue.  Then, instead of producing a term paper, well collaborate with a team from CMUs Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) to design and prototype a next-generation learning tool that brings the issue to life.

What is the proper scope for legitimate law?  If the legal system lacks features that are essential for legitimacy, what (if anything) does that license us to do?

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

War starkly divides society by gender through the mass mobilization of men into military service.  In this sense, it heightens gender roles and polarities.  At the same time, it also pushes women into occupations and positions previously filled by men, and opens new opportunities for women in the economy, within the household, and even the military.  It upends traditional power relations and creates new hierarchies at home and at the front.  It also leaves women and children to the mercy of invading armies, alters childrearing patterns, and fractures the family.  Mass rape, displacement, homelessness, and refugee movements have accompanied war from time immemorial.  Certain wartime practices may be seen as universal, persisting from one war to the next, while others are historical and consonant only with specific conditions.  War provides a heightened lens through which to view gender because it both erodes and intensifies the gender conceptions and social practices of peacetime.    In this course we will examine 300 years of war in the United States, Europe, and Russia beginning in the 18th and ending in the 20th century.  We will focus on specific wars in an attempt to understand how war changes gender and family relations, and how it affects the experiences of women.  We will explore the differences between the experiences of men and women at the front, in the rear, under occupation, and as victims of genocide and terror.", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null,

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.  This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences.

It is increasingly being collected from many different sources and it is affecting the decisions we make in all aspects of our lives. It is also growing both in size and in complexity, demanding an arsenal of new tools and techniques for us to make sense of it. Overcoming these challenges is the goal of data science. Data scientists have to know how to collect the data, clean it up and make it ready for analytics. They have to know which platforms or data structures work best for each use case and what trade-offs they offer. When the data is prepared, data scientists should be able to use a range of mathematical tools to probe the data. This may include statistical analysis, or machine learning methods, or visualization systems to find meanings and patterns inside the data. Data analysis is an iterative process. In each iteration, we may gain new insights, or test new hypotheses, or even find new questions. Turning the data into knowledge is an important step, but it wouldnt be effective if the analyst cannot communicate it with others. Effective means of communicating this knowledge such as visualization play a key role in data driven decision making.   In this introductory course, we will provide an overview of the major aspects of data science with slightly more focus on visualization as a beneficial medium for understanding and communicating data. We will look at some of the well-known tools frequently used by data scientists and we will utilize them as we try to make sense of a real world dataset.

The topics covered will include man-machine coupling, underlying robotic technologies, as they relate to human-robot interaction, interaction methodologies and techniques, the singularity, and will include significant discussion of application domains that feature HRI.    This course has no prerequisites, but some basic familiarity with robots is recommended (programming knowledge is not necessary, but is useful for the term project).", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "NSH", "end": "01:20PM", "begin": "12:00PM", "room": "3002", "days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Nourbakhsh, Illah"]}], "coreqs": null, "units": 12.0, "department": "Robotics", "prereqs": null, "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}}, "57-522": {"name": "Major Studio (Bagpipe)", "desc": "A one hour private lesson per week for all music majors.", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "DNM", "end": null, "begin": null, "room": "DNM", "days": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Carlisle, Andrew"]}], "coreqs": null, "units": 9.0, "department": "Music", "prereqs": null, "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}}, "18-859": {"name": "Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing", "desc": "Please go to the ECE Website to view Special Topics in Communications course descriptions.      http://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/index.html", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"name": "F", "times": [{"building": "HH", "end": "05:50PM", "begin": "04:30PM", "room": "1107", "days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Suresh Kumar, Swarun Kumar"]}, {"name": "H", "times": [{"building": "HH", "end": "02:20PM", "begin": "12:30PM", "room": "1107", "days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Tonguz, Ozan"]}, {"name": "SH", "times": [{"building": "B23", "end": "11:20AM", "begin": "09:30AM", "room": "118", "days": [1, 3], "location": "San Jose, California"}], "instructors": ["Tonguz, Ozan"]}], "coreqs": null, "units": 12.0, "department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "prereqs": "36-217", "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["36-217"]]}}, "54-442": {"name": "Costume Design for the Classics", "desc": "This Mini 3 focuses on a range of playwrights and classic theatre genres from among Moliere, Brecht and Shakespeare.

Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently.  This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development.

We will focus on learning the types of data that can be used with particular analytic methods, as well as on learning which types of analytic methods are appropriate for which types of research questions. As such, we will learn when and how to manipulate existing data through the creation of dummy variables or composite variables, through data transformations, and through coding procedures for changing text into analyzable numeric data. We will also learn how to assess the degree of missing data and how to handle problematic levels of missing data, how to interpret statistical results, and how to present findings in text and in graphic format.

The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting.

As a result, present-day decision makers face an increasingly formidable task of internalizing huge amounts of time-critical information while being expected to always make the right decisions at the right times.  Conveniently, Data Science comes to their rescue.  Applied Data Science aims to achieve two main goals. The first is to optimize the efficiency of decision making by human managers. The second is to maximize the utilization of available data, so that no important clue is ever missed. This course aims at building expertize required to achieve those goals in practice. Students will have the opportunity to gain and solidify knowledge of the most important contemporary methods of Data Science, and to develop understanding of practical applicability of the studied topics in business scenarios. They will be able learn how to formulate analytic tasks in support of business objectives, how to define successful analytic projects, and how to evaluate utility of existing and potential applications of the discussed technologies in practice.  The instructor is a scientist and a practitioner. He has been involved in research towards various topics of machine intelligence and its applications for over two decades. He has been a technical lead and executive in the new technology industry. Currently Dr. Dubrawski is faculty at the CMU Robotics Institute where he directs the Auton Lab and leads multiple Applied Data Science projects in support of industry, government, and non-governmental organizations.", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"name": "A4", "times": [{"building": "HBH", "end": "04:20PM", "begin": "03:00PM", "room": "1502", "days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"building": "HBH", "end": "05:50PM", "begin": "04:30PM", "room": "1502", "days": [5], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Dubrawski, Artur"]}], "coreqs": null, "units": 6.0, "department": "Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt", "prereqs": null, "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}}, "15-605": {"name": "Operating System Design and Implementaion", "desc": "Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems.

Often, behind a foreign accent, we encounter an entirely different worldview. The same word or phrase in English might actually carry very distinct connotations for someone whose native language is French, German, Russian, or Japanese. Can we learn to anticipate, understand, and become sensitive to these connotations? How can we mend potential miscommunications that might arise due to these conceptual differences?

We will talk about the way in which culture influences communication, about the job of translators and interpreters, and about specific communicative norms for the global marketplace.

If human rights exist, whose responsibility is it to see that they are defended/provided/not violated, and why?

The students come from a variety of backgrounds including Computer Science, Psychology, Design, and other related programs. The industrial client defines the project area and guides its direction. In the first few months of the project (January to April), students conduct user research and brainstorm product ideas. The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. They do weekly iteration cycles, so by the end of the summer, product prototypes are well refined and adapted to user needs.

Spring 2013: Ever since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the technological exhibition in the nineteenth century, there has been a growing presence for science and technology in the lives of everyday citizens. In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the publics imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

Students learn a range of topics, including experimental design, structural biology, next generation sequencing, genomics, proteomics, bioimaging, and high-content screening. Class sessions are primarily devoted to designing and performing experiments in the lab using the above techniques. Students are required to keep a detailed laboratory notebook of their experiments and summarize their resulting data in written abstracts and oral presentations given in class-hosted lab meetings. With an emphasis on the basics of experimentation and broad views of multiple cutting-edge and high-throughput techniques, this course is appropriate for students who have never taken a traditional undergraduate biology lab course, as well as those who have and are looking for introductory training in more advanced approaches.

The value premise has elevated business marketing beyond the usual tactical execution by determining the best fit between targeted segment needs and the configuration of resources into a value package having documented impact.  The present strategic importance of marketing in companies has resulted from significant changes that have occurred in business-to-business marketing during the past two decades.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing.

In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing.

Students will meet twice a week for seven weeks to practice skills in audience analysis, organization, visual design, delivery, and self-assessment. These skills will be practiced in a series of short, preparatory exercises resulting in a final presentation of either a job talk or professional paper. These exercises, as well as the final presentation, will be reviewed by both the student and the instructor.  The practicum will be taught on a pass/fail basis. A pass signifies that the participant has prepared for and attended 100 of the class sessions and has actively participated in peer reviews of work presented by other class participants.

While useful, Kitwanas definition is also quite provocative since many of the earliest practitioners (and consumers) of what would eventually be called hip-hop were not all African-Americans but Greeks, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Jamaicans, Germans, Trinidadians, Mexicans, etc..., many of whom lived in America but also encountered hip-hop elsewhere on the planet.

Despite its benefits, the practice of risk management in industry is ad-hoc, inconsistent, and often ineffective, leading decision makers to make poor choices based upon lack of, or mis-communicated, information.  The goal of this course is to develop risk managers; individuals who are capable of identifying both the risks and the underlying factors influencing them in order make better project decisions. Students will become familiar with existing tools, techniques and strategies that serve to identify, analyze and assist in mitigating or avoiding risks.

The purpose of this course is to explore Hispanic culture and history through contemporary films in Spanish.  Undoubtedly, films are a rich source of meaningful cultural information that can provide the audience with an understanding of a countrys culture (history, politics, social problems, etc.) through their discussion and analysis.  Movies not only represent reality, but they do it from a particular position. The images produced in films are charged with political interests that reproduce or challenge established beliefs and views. Films offer different representations of reality as well as different ways of relating to it (Achugar, 2008).  We will view and analyze a selected group of films portraying four main issues in Hispanic history and society: memory and oblivion, immigration and exile, marginalized identities throughout history, and the Hispanic world in globalization.  An understanding of the socio-political context that these films aim to portray through in-depth reading, analysis, discussion, and investigation will provide a thorough understanding of the complexities of various historic events, and opportunities and challenges faced by the Hispanic world.  Throughout the semester, we will practice the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) as we continue to build on vocabulary and review grammar points based on the films viewed, the texts read, and the topics discussed.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.  This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics.

(3) Given an interaction network of users on eBay with a subset of nodes identified as fraudsters (labeled training data), which are the most likely other users that are fraudsters too based on common interaction patterns?

The deductive approach to the specification of programming languages has become standard practice, and one of the goals of this course is to provide a good working knowledge of how to engineer such language descriptions. Throughout the course we will use Twelf as a uniform meta-language in which we can express specification, implementation, and meta-theory of the object languages we are considering.

After completing the course, students will be able to:  *select and apply an appropriate supervised learning algorithm for classification problems (e.g., naive Bayes, perceptron, support vector machine, logistic regression).   *select and apply an appropriate supervised learning algorithm for regression problems (e.g., linear regression, ridge regression).  *recognize different types of unsupervised learning problems, and select and apply appropriate algorithms (e.g., clustering, linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction).   *work with probabilities (Bayes rule, conditioning, expectations, independence), linear algebra (vector and matrix operations, eigenvectors, SVD), and calculus (gradients, Jacobians) to derive machine learning methods such as linear regression, naive Bayes, and principal components analysis.   *understand machine learning principles such as model selection, overfitting, and underfitting, and techniques such as cross-validation and regularization.   *implement machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression via stochastic gradient descent, linear regression (using a linear algebra toolbox), perceptron, or k-means clustering.   *run appropriate supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on real and synthetic data sets and interpret the results.", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["21-325", "15-359", "36-225", "36-217"]]}, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "GHC", "end": "01:20PM", "begin": "12:00PM", "room": "4303", "days": [2, 4], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Singh, Aarti", "Poczos, Barnabas"]}], "coreqs": "21-325 or 15-359 or 36-225 or 36-217", "units": 12.0, "department": "Machine Learning", "prereqs": "(15-122 and 21-127) or (15-122 and 15-151)", "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": true, "reqs_list": [["15-122", "21-127"], ["15-122", "15-151"]]}}, "57-297": {"name": "Keyboard Studies (Studio)", "desc": "None", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "DNM", "end": null, "begin": null, "room": "DNM", "days": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Larocca, Carla", "Li, Hanna"]}], "coreqs": null, "units": 3.0, "department": "Music", "prereqs": "57-296", "sections": [], "prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["57-296"]]}}, "15-122": {"name": "Principles of Imperative Computation", "desc": "For students with a basic understanding of programming (variables, expressions, loops, arrays, functions).

Discussions about particular artworks and trends will engage with questions posed by the artists, such as: How can art represent identity? What is the difference between artwork and document?

What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?  The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.
